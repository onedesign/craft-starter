/**
 * Logging in Craft involves using one of the following methods:
 *
 * Craft::trace(): record a message to trace how a piece of code runs. This is mainly for development use.
 * Craft::info(): record a message that conveys some useful information.
 * Craft::warning(): record a warning message that indicates something unexpected has happened.
 * Craft::error(): record a fatal error that should be investigated as soon as possible.
 *
 * Unless `devMode` is on, only Craft::warning() & Craft::error() will log to `craft/storage/logs/web.log`
 *
 * It's recommended that you pass in the magic constant `__METHOD__` as the second parameter, which sets
 * the category to the method (prefixed with the fully qualified class name) where the constant appears.
